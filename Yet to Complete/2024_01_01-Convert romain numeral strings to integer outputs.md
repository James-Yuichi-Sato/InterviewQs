## Question

Write a function that will input a roman numeral and return the integer output. Your function will only need to deal with a max input of 3,999. Additionally, you can reference the following dictionary for conversions:

```python
{"I": 1, "V": 5, "X": 10, "L": 50, "C": 100, "D": 500, "M": 1000}
```

    

For example:

```text
"CCVII" -> returns 207
    
"VII" -> returns 7
```
