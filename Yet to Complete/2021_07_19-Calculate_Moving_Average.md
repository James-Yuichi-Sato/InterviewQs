You are given a list of numbers J and a single number p.  Write a function to return the minimum and maximum averages of the sequences of p numbers in the list J.


    
For example:


    
    
# Array of numbers
    

J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]
    

# Length of sequences, p
    

p = 3
    


    
Here, the sequences will be:


    

    
(4,4,4)

    
(4,4,9)

    
(4,9,10)

    
(9,10,11)

    
(10,11,12)

    

    
    
    
From the above we can see that the minimum average will be 4 and the maximum average will be 11, which corresponds to the first and last sequences.
