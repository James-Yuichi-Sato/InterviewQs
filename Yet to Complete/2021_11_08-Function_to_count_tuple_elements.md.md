Suppose you are given a tuple containing ints and strings. Write a Python function to return the # of times a given element, n, appears in the tuple.


    
For example, given the tuple below, where n=3, your function should return 4, since 3 appears 4 times in the tuple.


    
    
input:
    

         n = 3
    

         my_tuple = 2, 'my_string', 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3


    
output:
    

         4
