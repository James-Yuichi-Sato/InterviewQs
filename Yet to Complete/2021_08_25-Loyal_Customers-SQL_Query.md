You are an analyst for a major US hotel chain which has locations all over the US. Your marketing team is planning a promotion focused around loyal customers, and they are trying to forecast how much revenue the promotion will bring in. However, they need help from you to understand how much revenue comes from "loyal" customers to plug into their model. 
    

    

A "loyal" customer is defined as 
    


    
having a membership with your company's point system, 
    
meeting either of the below conditions
    

    
 having >2 stays at any hotel location
    
 having stayed at 3 different locations
    

    

    
You have a table showing all transactions made in 2017. The schema of the table is below:


    
Table: customer_transactions


    
Column Name	Data Type	Description
customer_id	id	id of the customer
hotel_id	integer	unique id for hotel
transaction_id	integer	id of the given transaction
first_night	string	first night of the stay, column format is "YYYY-mm-dd" 
number_of_nights	integer	# of nights the customer stayed in hotel
total_spend	integer	total spend for transaction, in USD
is_member	boolean	indicates if the customer is a member of our points system

    

    
Given this, can you write a SQL query that calculates percent of revenue loyal customers brought in 2017?
