## Question
Suppose you are playing a game with a fair die (e.g. no bias for any one side), and your expected payout based on the # you roll is in the table below:

| Roll | Payout |
| ---- | ------ |
| 6 | $4 |
| 5 | $2 |
| 4 | $1 |
| 3 | $0 |
| 2 | $0 |
| 1 | $0 |

Given the above table, is it worth it to play this game?

## Solution
This problem is an open-ended expected value problem. This problem is asking at what value would it be a positive expected value ROI.

Expected value for this fair dice problem is the sum of the payouts multiplied by the probability of each payout as explained in this nice and succinct Investopedia page [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expected-value.asp).

For this problem, the expected value is ***$1.17***. This means that any buy-in of less than ***$1.17*** is worth playing in the long run.
